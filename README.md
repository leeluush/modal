# Modal Exercise

This project demonstrates how to implement a modal window using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Modals are a common UI component used to display important messages, forms, or any other content that requires user interaction without navigating away from the current page.

## Features

- **HTML**: Basic structure for the modal and main content.
- **CSS**: Styling for the modal, buttons, and other elements to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: Script to handle the opening and closing of the modal.

## How to Use

1. Click the "Open Modal" button to display the modal.
2. Click the "Ã—" button or anywhere outside the modal to close it.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the main HTML structure.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS for styling the page and modal.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript for handling modal interactions.
